Wall Mounted Makeup Organizer Vanity (Pre-Order) Ship out Jan 3rd!
<Description>
I&#39;m so excited to finally bring out this new makeup organizer that I designed to make your life that much easier! It&#39;s the ultimate makeup vanity solution when space is limited. This modern design fits all your daily needs in one place right at your fingertips. No more drawers with cluttered makeup and\/or makeup bags to dig through. I personally dislike anything that covers with dust within a week because of the time it takes to clean each item that sits on your countertop. With this wall mounted makeup organizer, you can keep all the items you want hidden, showcase all the pretty makeup that you love, and while cutting out the cleaning time all together! \n\nThis design goes perfect with the jewelry organizer and is made from the same wood and finish. Mix or match the colors of the organizers to design and create your own beautiful dream space where you can get ready stress free! \n\nThis comes with a matching wood framed 18 1\/2&quot; X 13 1\/2&quot; mirror that is placed horizontally onto the top slot.  For the ultimate vanity effect a bigger mirror is recommended. The mirror can be either placed onto the top slot, or mounted onto the wall on top of the organizer. Try a lighted mirror for a professional studio feel!\n\nAny chair or stool can be used. Adjust and mount the organizer accordingly to the height of the chair or stool.\n\nDetails - The top of the organizer has a small dip where you can keep things from rolling off or hold items while in use. The left side door opens up to two storage boxes. Fill this with small samples, lip gloss, and q-tips etc.. The inside has 45 lipstick holders, where you can see each color on the ends. The acrylic lipstick holder is removable, in case you want to place bigger items inside instead such as skincare. The center of the organizer has an opening to place your beautiful perfume bottles, and\/or just anything you would like to display. Underneath that is a drawer with an acrylic divider that can be removed and fit items such as compacts, eyelash curler, and anything you want to grab on hand. To the side is two removable acrylic dividers that have 3 slots for your makeup palettes. Remove one divider and place a taller item such as perfume bottles, or skincare bottles. The bottom of the organizer has two acrylic drawers with removable wooden display holders. The display holder is used to showcase eyeshadow colors and blushes etc.. but if you want to have more storage space, remove the wooden holder with the sticker that holds it in place, and you&#39;ll have two bigger areas where you can store anything! The right side door opens up to two bigger storage boxes. The top one has small square acrylic dividers that holds brushes, eye liners, lip liners, mascara, and anything that is slim. This divider can also be removed. Inside the door are 3 rows of shelf space perfect to hold and display nail polishes, but can be used for anything. There are 3 removable acrylic slits to hold things in place, and is designed to take out if bigger items need extra space. \n\nMeasurements - 26&quot; X 6 1\/2&quot; X 15&quot;\n\nColors available - Natural grey wood (tone and grain will vary)\n                              - Black\n                              - White\n                              - Natural yellow wood\n\nMounting Frame - The back has two metal holes (similar to picture frames) that hang flush to wall with two long screws. (If not screwed to wall studs, anchor clips with screws are recommended with dry wall) Detailed instructions are printed on the box.\n\n(Feel free to message me anytime regarding any questions you may have)\nPlease note: This product is produced in Qingdao, China. Due to efficiency standards, production had to be outsourced. The design and concept is 100% original by Bleach LA Furnishings.\n\nThis is a very limited product so get yours while they are in stock!

Amelie Music Box Eiffel Tower. Hand Cranked Music Box.
<Description>
Small cardboard music box decorated with the Eiffel Tower. It has the melody of Amelie `s Waltz.\nIdeal as a detail to give in a special moment. Imagine gifting your wedding guests a music box, or your partner, or that special someone.\nMeasures: Diameter: 5,5cms Altura: 4,5cms\n\nPlease take a note that my work in this product is to change the music mechanism. The box itself is not handmade by me. Also, the box has a hand-cranked musical movement; you have to keep winding it in order to hear the music. You can see it in this link: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z2bROXO5LdI\n\nAbout the packaging: I send these boxes in an envelope with buble wrap. It is the best I can do to protect the little music boxes in a light maner. If the packages were heavier, the shipping cost would be double price. I have sent hundreds of these envelopes and I have had a problem just once... it is just for your information.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nThe regular delivery times given by the Spanish shipping office are these:\nPLEASE NOTE THESE ARE AFTER THE ORDER IS READY \n- Spain: 3 days\n- Europe: 7 days.\n- Rest of the world: 12 days. (There are delays in USA and Latin-America).\nThese delivery times are not guaranteed neither by me nor by the post office so there won`t be refund of money if the packet is late unless it is because of a mistake caused by me.\nIf the postman doesn`t find anybody in the address you write in your order, they will send the packet back to me so be careful the days after you make your order.

The Legend of Zelda (SNES) - &quot;Master Sword&quot; 3D Video Game Shadow Box with Glass Frame
<Description>
This iconic scene from The Legend of Zelda - A Link to the Past marks the moment when Link finds the Master Sword resting on a pedestal in a glade inside the Lost Woods forest. Despite all the time Link spends searching for the Master Sword, it feels like your adventure is just beginning when you wield it for the first time.\n\nTo this day, A Link to the Past is my favorite style of sprite artwork. Everything is so colorful and cleanly drawn and it sucks you into the world. I love how this scene is framed by the trees and accompanied by birds and squirrels from the forest.\n\nThis glass-framed shadow box measures 10x12.5 inches and the viewport matches the 4:3 aspect ratio of the original scene. All of the images are printed on high-quality matte cardstock and laser cut for precision. The sprites are layered and raised to create a three-dimensional image that brings the scene to life. Pictures do not do it justice!

Handmade Sterling Silver Bracelet with Heart-Shaped Motif
<Description>
This handmade bracelet is a unique design of mine constructed of links cast in sterling silver.  Each hinged link is a silhouette in an abstract design, joined by hand and foot, forming heart-shaped spaces in between.  The hinges are hand fabricated from heavy walled sterling tubing and sterling wire hinge pins.  The bracelet secures with a hand fabricated sterling box clasp with a safety lock.  \n\nThe bracelet measures 11mm wide &quot;head to foot&quot;, and 2.5mm in the thickest part.\n2 lengths are currently in stock:\n\n1 at 7 1\/2 in.\n1 at 8 in.\n\nI can size either of these up or down - please convo me when ordering.  If you would like a size that is not in stock, please convo me and I can make one custom for you.  I can also do versions of this bracelet in 14k or 18k yellow or white gold - convo me for details and pricing.  Please note that due to the handmade nature of this bracelet it can take up to 2-3 weeks before a custom order will ship.\n\nThis bracelet is made using a multi-step process.  I begin by hand carving a model in wax, which is then used to make a rubber mold.  Wax is injected into the mold to recreate the original carving.  I then manipulate this wax copy with a combination of carving, building up, and flame burnishing to create a unique design.  The finished wax copy is then cast in metal to form the final piece.  This process ensures that each bracelet is a distinct creation.\n\nI have an entire line of jewelry based on this design, including rings, pendants, earrings, cufflinks, and pins.  These pieces may be accented with a variety of semi-precious and precious heart-shaped stones in open back step bezel settings, and briolettes can be added to make drop earrings and pendants.\n\nPlease check out the other items in this line, and other unique pieces of mine, in the Handmade section of my shop.\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/JosephVeederJewelry?section_id=16096081&ref=shopsection_leftnav_1\n\n\u00a92015 Joseph Veeder Jewelry LLC\nAll handmade jewelry, designs, and listing content are the intellectual property of Joseph Veeder Jewelry LLC.

Portugal Blue Antique Azulejo Tile Replica Post Stud Earrings from Ovar (see photo of actual facade) Gift Box Included - Ships from USA 621
<Description>
These tiles are located on the facade of a very, very old building in the lovely town of Ovar. To my dismay, many old buildings have fallen in disrepair and this is an attempt to preserve a little of the patrimony of Portugal before it&#39;s too late.\n\nOvar was founded in 1251! Surrounded by lagoons and saltpans, Ovar is conveniently located between the northern cities of Porto and Aveiro.\nIt is an unusual town where some of the women still wear black pork-pie hats and walk around the streets barefoot. Many of the local inhabitants are descendants of Phoenician sailors who settled around these shores because they were attracted by the purity of the sky and the excellent fishing to be had.  (see photo of actual Facade)\n\n\nThis tiles are a little less than 1cm square. Sweet! They are nickel free metal.  You can find a 925 Silver option here:  https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/247985734\/portugal-blue-antique-azulejo-tile?ref=shop_home_active_1\n\nWear a Piece of History!\n\nAll my tiles are replicas made of polymer clay where the image actually becomes part of the clay through baking. No glue is used in the process. The pieces become waterproof and scratch resistant. Due to the handmade and hand shaped nature of each tile, slight variations will occur, as no two pieces are alike.\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to email me with any questions you may have.\n\nThank you,\nAtrio
